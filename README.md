## What is ToDo? 

* Quick summary: ToDoooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.
* It's yet another ToDo-list app, but with quirky features and implementations built in. It's my experimentation with various the Android functions and third-party libraries.
* Powered by SQLite.

## Features 

* Dynamic theme
* Dynamic font (Google Font)
* Smart date parsing for ToDos
* Reminders for ToDos
* Tags for ToDos
* Dynamic Importance system
* And more...

## Future 

Probably more interesting stuff that I want to experiment with, like cloud syncing.

Improve code quality and poor implementations (depreciated stuff).

And more...
